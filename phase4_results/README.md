Hybrid Prompting Experiment results

Prompt:
“In a universe where gravity follows an inverse cubic law, scientists are working on new ways to model planetary orbits. The following is a passage from a textbook on the subject: 'Because the gravitational force decreases so rapidly with distance, the stable elliptical orbits described by Kepler's Laws are not possible. However, the model correctly predicts the orbits of comets, which are known to follow the inverse square law”
